jQuery Vibrate Plugin allows you to have "vibrating" tags in your page, like buttons, DIVs, etc. It is very simple to use and integrate, and lightweight (less than 3 kB in minified version)

== DOCUMENTATION ==
The Vibrate plugin has some configurable options. Below is an example of available options and their defaults:

$('.vibrate').vibrate({
    speed: 50, // Vibration speed in milliseconds
    trigger: "mouseover", // Triggering event
    reverse: false, // Reverse behaviour
    overEffect: "stop" // Over effect, see details below
})

== OPTIONS ==
speed: default value is 50 milliseconds, but can be changed

trigger: it is the triggering event. Default value is "mouseover", another acceptable value is "focus"; other events are not managed

reverse: default value is false; if true, the behaviour will be reversed. E.g., if triggering event is "mouseover", the tag will always vibrate but stop when mouse is over.

overEffect: this is used only when "reverse" parameter is true. The appliable values are "" (empty string), "stop" or "invert". Default value is "stop":
- "stop" (default value): when mouse is over the vibration will be stopped and it will start again when mouse is out;
- "" (empty string): when mouse is over the vibration will continue without stopping
